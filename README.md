# Goal Selection Strategies for Learning Goal-Oriented Value Functions

**Degree:** COMS

**Description:** Recent work in compositional reinforcement learning has demonstrated how to
combine skills to solve tasks specified using Boolean algebra operators. However, the algorithm
to do so uses standard Q-learning with epsilon greedy exploration. One aspect of the algorithm
is the way the agent decides on which goal to explore, which is currently done in a greedy
fashion. In this project, we propose extending this algorithm to **incorporate different ways of goal
selection**, such as through uniform random or bandit-based strategies. This project also involves
the creation of a virtual environment in Unity or mujoco-worldgen.
